# React Challenge: React Portfolio

This is a portfolio page. It's supposed to use react.js, but it doesn't.

Incidentally, I'm pretty sure react.js would not be the appropriate tool to use for a project like this. (I mean, in a normal context; outside the context of "prove that you can competently use react.js")

## Portfolio of the Works of Dennis Inglehart

A simple, one-page website with internal links to contact and resume information, and external links to projects Dennis Inglehart worked on.

It's a copy of the Module Two Challenge, which was also a portfolio [repo link](https://github.com/Dennis-Inglehart/module-two-challenge) - [site link](https://dennis-inglehart.github.io/module-two-challenge/).
